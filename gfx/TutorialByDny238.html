<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Summary</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
are two major styles of sync that will be covered in this guide. First, 
we&#39;ll cover how to sync a file produced by the capture of a Closed Captioned 
broadcast (CC Sync). These files inherently have some offset consistency. 
However, they typically need to have the captions from commercials removed.</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
second style of sync covered by this guide is a more difficult process 
of syncing a file which has very little internal consistency, meaning 
every line needs to be corrected individually (Random Sync). There are 
several other situations you may encounter, including files which have 
a frame rate issues and appear to drift consistently, but this guide 
won&#39;t cover those issues yet.  </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
is also an activity of &#39;Correcting&#39; the subtitle. This process looks 
to corrected a variety of issues with the text: Spelling, Capitalization, 
Punctuational, Formatting, etc. This guide won&#39;t fully cover the process 
of correction either.</font> <br></p>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Prerequisites</b></font></p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Get a copy of Subtitle 
  Edit (SE) from </font><a href="http://nikse.dk" target="_blank"><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>http://nikse.dk</u></font></a></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Get a subtitle you 
  wish to sync</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Get a video you 
  wish to sync against</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rename the subtitle 
  to match the name of the video, only the extension should be different. 
  (Video.avi, Video.srt) This will help SE find the proper video automatically. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Save the subtitle 
  in the same directory as the video and open it with SE. </font></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>CC Sync</b></font></p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Before you correct 
  start to correct the sync, it&#39;s best to run the &#39;Fix common errors...&#39; 
  tool. In addition to a number of style improvements, this will correct 
  any overlapping problems in the subtitle and make sure none of the lines 
  are too quick. These overlaps can be very confusing when you&#39;re getting 
  started. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now you are ready 
  to start the sync. Double click the first line of the file. This will 
  open the &#39;Create/Adjust lines&#39; view. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Highlight and Read 
  the first line of the subtitle</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit the &#39;Play/Pause&#39; 
  button to start the video preview.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once you hear the 
  the first line, hit &#39;&lt; 3 Seconds&#39; to give yourself a chance get it 
  right.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit &#39;Play/Pause&#39; 
  right as the line starts</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit &#39;&lt; ½ Seconds&#39; 
  to position the video &#39;head&#39; right before your line. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Make sure you&#39;ve 
  properly highlighted the appropriate line in the list on the right. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit &#39;Set Start and 
  offset the rest&#39;. This button with move the start time of the highlighted 
  line to match the position of the video play head. The remaining lines 
  in the file are adjusted by whatever amount the highlighted line was 
  adjusted by. The net result is that if you timed it right, you&#39;ve now 
  synced this file up to the first commercial. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit &#39;Play/Pause&#39; 
  or double click the line in the list to start the video playing from 
  the position. If the offset appears to be corrected let the video roll. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After reviewing 
  a few lines, if there aren&#39;t any issues hit the &#39;&gt; 1 minute&#39; to advance 
  your position in the file and preview a few lines. If there are consistent 
  offset issues, back up until you don&#39;t have the problem any more and 
  offset the lines as necessary by repeating steps 3-10.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Eventually you&#39;ll 
  encounter the commercial break in the subtitle file, the lines of dialog 
  in the preview won&#39;t match the video at all. Back the video up until 
  you find where the first line of dialog starts again (after where the 
  commercials were removed). </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Highlight the first 
  line of the commercials, scroll down until you read that first line 
  of dialog you heard in step 10. Shift click to highlight the entire 
  commercial block and hit delete to remove them. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Repeats steps 2-7 
  to get the subtitle back in sync from here on down. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This process of 
  sync and review until the entire file is corrected</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Give yourself credit 
  by inserting two new subtitle lines, one towards the start and one at 
  the end. We recommend something like synced by dny238 / </font><a href="http://www.addic7ed.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#000080" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>www.addic7ed.com</u></font></a></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Close the &#39;Create 
  / Adjust lines&#39; dialog.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Rerun the &#39;Fix 
  common errors...&#39; to reconcile any overlaps you may have created lining 
  things up. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Save the file. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">You are done! Upload 
  the video to the site and move on to the next sync.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If you have a few 
  extra minutes considering doing some quick corrections. Typically a 
  proper corrector will follow you, but depending on your work load there 
  are a few quick things you can do to make your product cleaner. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Start by using 
  &#39;Change case&#39;, this will attempt to fix capitalization issues in the 
  file. This is quick. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Next run a spell 
  check, a more time consuming process. In addition to typos and glitches, 
  it&#39;s common to fine more names during spell check which were missed. 
  Correct them on the line supplied and add them to the names file to 
  save yourself time in the future. </font></li>
</ol>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Random Sync</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This process is inherently 
slower than CC Sync because every line is potentially wrong. Hopefully, 
we can at least get close to realtime sync using the process described 
below. The concept here is that most dialog follows immediately after 
the line before it, so all you need to do is tell the program when each 
line ends and it&#39;ll automatically set the start time on the subsequent 
line. Said again more simply, you watch the video, at the end of each 
line hit control-e. The program will set the end of that line, and move 
itself to the next line. Repeat. </font> <br></p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Double click the 
  first line of dialog to open the &#39;Create/adjust lines&#39;. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Highlight the first 
  line in the subtitle. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Hit &#39;Play/Pause&#39; 
  to start the video</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Once you hear the 
  line start, pause the video, back it up and hit &#39;Set start and offset 
  the rest&#39; as described above, or use &#39;Set start time&#39; or Cntl-S to set 
  the start position.  This button doesn&#39;t adjust the end time, so 
  use it cautiously, you&#39;re committing to adjusting the lines end time 
  manually too. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Back the video up 
  3 seconds to give yourself time to review your work and get ready.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">After the video 
  plays the dialog on your line, hit &#39;Set end time&#39; or preferably Cntl-E 
  right as the dialog on the current line ends. This sets the end time 
  of the current line. It then advances the selection to the next line 
  and sets it&#39;s start position. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">If the dialog follows 
  immediately, you&#39;re all set. If not hit, Cntl-S repeatedly until right 
  before the dialog starts again. This takes some practice and you can 
  pause if necessary, adjust the play head and hit the button at exactly 
  the right position, then continue. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Let the video play 
  and hit Cntl-E at the end of the next line. Repeat for each line of 
  the file. </font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Most of the time 
  you can sync a file at near real-time. </font></li>
